# PyTorch Simple Linear Regression

In the Jupyter Notebooks, a simple Linear Regression machine learning algorithm using PyTorch is implemented with Python programming. The Linear Regression model makes predictions about a person's salary. If an employee has more experience, the higher output salary prediction from the Linear Regression model. The less employee experience, the lower the salary output prediction from the Linear Regression model. The ScikitLearn machine learning library with NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Scipy has been used to process the data and evaluate performance metrics from the Linear Regression model.

Although this is a very small dataset for a model to make predictions on, it provides an introduction to machine learning and how to use the PyTorch framework simultaneously.

PyTorch_simple_linear_regression.ipynb -  is for training, evaluation and saving the trained weights file for the Linear Regression model to an output folder directory.

PyTorch_simple_linear_regression_saved_model_prediction.ipynb - demonstrates loading the saved weights file for the trained Linear Regression model to a Jupyter Notebook and making a prediction on one employee's experience for 2.3 years of experience.
